## [0.15.0] - 2021-02-12 - Seonyudo (선유도, 仙遊島)

NeoFS nodes are now preview5-compatible. 

IR nodes are now engaged in the distribution of funds to the storage nodes:
for the passed audit and for the amount of stored information. All timers 
of the IR nodes related to the generation and processing of global system 
events are decoupled from astronomical time, and are measured in the number 
of blockchain blocks.

For the geographic positioning of storage nodes, a global NeoFS location
database is now used, the key in which is a UN/LOCODE, and the base itself 
is generated on the basis of the UN/LOCODE and OpenFlights databases.

### Added
- Timers with time in blocks of the chain.
- Subscriptions to new blocks in blockchain event `Listener`.
- Tracking the volume of stored information by containers in the 
  storage engine and an external interface for obtaining this data.
- `TransferX` operation in sidechain client.
- Calculators of audit and basic settlements.
- Distribution of funds to storage nodes for audit and for the amount 
  of stored information (settlement processors of IR).
- NeoFS API `Container.AnnounceUsedSpace` RPC service.
- Exchange of information about container volumes between storage nodes 
  controlled by IR through sidechain notifications.
- Support of new search matchers (`STRING_NOT_EQUAL`, `NOT_PRESENT`).
- Functional for the formation of NeoFS location database.
- CLI commands for generating and reading the location database.
- Checking the locode attribute and generating geographic attributes 
  for candidates for a network map on IR side.
- Verification of the eACL signature when checking Object ACL rules.

### Fixed
- Overwriting the local configuration of node attributes when updating 
  the network map.
- Ignoring the X-headers CLI `storagegroup` commands.
