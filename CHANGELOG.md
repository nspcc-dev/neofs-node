### Updating from v0.45.2
`apiclient.allow_external` field must be dropped from any SN configuration.
Also, SN `ExternalAddr` attribute is no-op now and should also be removed.

The node config has been changed. Instead of the field `node.attribute_*`,
now there is a list `node.attributes`. Instead of `storage.shard.*`,
there is a list `storage.shards` with configuration of each shard and
`storage.shard.default` now is a `storage.shard_defaults` option with a configuration
of a default values of shards. Please rewrite this fields in your configuration files.

The section `morph` in the config has been renamed to `fschain` in the 0.43.0 release.
Compatibility code has been removed in this release.
Please rename `morph` to `fschain` in your configuration files.

Currently, in IR configuration only 2 fields are supported in the `contracts` section:
`contracts.neofs` and `contracts.processing`. The rest of the contracts,
along with the alphabet, were removed from the config.

In SN configuration section `contracts` is gone and no longer needed.

Experimental tree service is completely removed in this release, please drop
`tree` and `pilorama` configuration sections as well as pilorama DB files.

`netmap_cleaner` section should be removed from IR configuration.

Now the `blobstor` field in the shard configuration in the `storage` section
is not a list of substorages, but a single storage setting. So there is
only one type of storage now. Remove the list from the `blobstor` section in
config and set up one storage.

`small_object_size` section should be removed from shard configuration section for SN.

The deprecated `peapod` storage type and its associated migrator have been fully removed
from the system. All data must be migrated to the new storage type, and support
for peapod is no longer available. Please use `fstree` instead.

## [0.45.0] - 2025-02-27 - Sapsido

Unleashing the true scaling potential of NeoFS this release is the first one
to break the old ~320 node limit. It also brings a new powerful search API and
distributed settings management commands. Write cache received some care and
improved its efficiency. A number of other optimizations and fixes is included
as well.

### Added
- Initial support for meta-on-chain for objects (#2877)
- First split-object part into the CLI output (#3064)
- `neofs-cli control notary` with `list`, `request` and `sign` commands (#3059)

- A split expired object is not deleted after the lock is removed or expired (#3089)
- `neofs_node_engine_list_containers_time_bucket` and `neofs_node_engine_exists_time_bucket` metrics (#3014)
- `neofs_node_engine_list_objects_time_bucket` metric (#3120)

- Storage nodes running out of GAS because `putContainerSize` was not paid for by proxy (#3167)
- Write-cache flushing loop to drop objects (#3169)
- FS chain client pool overflows and event ordering (#3163)

### Changed
- Number of cuncurrenly handled notifications from the chain was increased from 10 to 300 for IR (#3068)
- Write-cache size estimations (#3106)
- New network map support solving the limit of ~320 nodes per network (#3088)
- Calculation of VUB for zero hash (#3134)
- More efficient block header subscription is used now instead of block-based one (#3163)
- `ObjectService.GetRange(Hash)` ops now handle zero ranges as full payload (#3071)
- Add some GAS to system fee of notary transactions (#3176)
- IR now applies sane limits to containers' storage policies recently added to the protocol (#3075)
- Make flushing objects in write-cache in parallel (#3179)

### Removed
- Drop creating new eacl tables with public keys (#3096)
- BoltDB from write-cache (#3091)

### Updated
- SDK to the post-api-go version (#3103)
- neofs-contracts to 0.21.0 (#3157)
- NeoGo to 0.108.0 (#3157)

### Updating from v0.44.2
Using public keys as a rule target in eACL tables was deprecated, and
since this realese it is not supported to create new eACL table with keys,
use addresses instead.
For more information call `neofs-cli acl extended create -h`.

`small_object_size`, `workers_number`, `max_batch_size` and `max_batch_delay`
paramteters are removed from `writecache` config. These parameters are related
to the BoltDB part of the write-cache, which is dropped from the code.
Also, because of this, there will be automatic migration from BoltDB by flushing
objects to the main storage and removing database file.

This version maintains two network map lists, the old one is used by default
and the new one will be used once "UseNodeV2" network-wide setting is set to
non-zero value. Storage nodes add their records to both lists by default, so
IR nodes must be updated first, otherwise SNs will fail to bootstrap. Monitor
candidates with neofs-adm and make a switch once all nodes are properly
migrated to the new list.

IR nodes using embedded CN require chain resynchronization (drop the DB to
do that) for this release because of NeoGo updates.

- Reloading pprof/metrics services with SIGHUP (#3016)
- Metrics for shard capacity (#3021)

### Fixed
- Searching (network-wide) for tombstones when handling their expiration, local indexes are used now instead (#2929)
- Unathorized container ops accepted by the IR (#2947)
- Structure table in the SN-configuration document (#2974)
- False negative connection to NeoFS chain in multi-endpoint setup with at least one live node (#2986)
- Overriding the default container and object attributes only with the appropriate flags (#2985)
- RPC client reconnection failures leading to complete SN failure (#2797)
- `meta.DB.Open(readOnly)` moves metabase in RO mode (#3000)
- Panic in event listener related to inability to switch RPC node (#2970)
- Non-container nodes never check placement policy on PUT, SEARCH requests (#3014)
- If shards are overloaded with PUT requests, operation is not skipped but waits for 30 seconds (#2871)
- Data corruption if PUT is done too concurrently (#2978)

### Changed
- `ObjectService`'s `Put` RPC handler caches up to 10K lists of per-object sorted container nodes (#2901)
- Metabase graveyard scheme (#2929)
- When an error is returned, no additional help output is displayed in cobra-based programs (#2942)
- Timestamps are no longer produced in logs if not running with TTY (#2964)
- In inner ring config, default ports for TCP addresses are used if they are missing (#2969)
- Metabase is refilled if an object exists in write-cache but is missing in metabase (#2977)
- Pprof and metrics services stop at the end of SN's application lifecycle (#2976)
- Reject configuration with unknown fields (#2981)
- Log sampling is disabled by default now (#3011)
- EACL is no longer considered for system role (#2972)
- Deprecate peapod substorage (#3013)
- Node does not stop trying to PUT an object if there are more PUT tasks than configured (#3027)
- `morph` configuration section renamed to `fschain` both in IR and SN (#3028)
- FSTree is limited to depth 8 max now (#3031)

### Removed
- Support for node.key configuration (#2959)
- `contracts.alphabet.amount` from inner ring config (#2960)

### Updated
- Go to 1.22 version (#2517, #2738)

### Updating from v0.43.0
Metabase version has been increased, auto migration will be performed once
v0.44.0 Storage Node is started with a v0.43.0 metabase. This action can
not be undone. No additional work should be done.

The new `storage.put_retry_timeout` config value added. If an object cannot
be PUT to storage, node tries to PUT it to the best shard for it (according to
placement sorting) and only to it for this long before operation error is
returned.

Binary keys are no longer supported by storage node, NEP-6 wallet support was
introduced in version 0.22.3 and support for binary keys was removed from
other components in 0.33.0 and 0.37.0. Please migrate to wallets (see 0.37.0
notes) if you've not done it previously.

The section `morph` in the config has been renamed to `fschain`. This version
still supports the old section name, but this compatibility code will be removed
in the next release. Please rename `morph` to `fschain` in your configuration files.

To migrate data from Peapods to FSTree:
```shell
$ peapod-to-fstree -config </path/to/storage/node/config>
```
For any shard, the data from the configured Peapod is copied into an FSTree
that must be already configured. Notice that peapod DB is not deleted during
migration. An updated (peapod-free) configuration file is also created with
".migrated" suffix (for example, `/etc/neofs/config.yaml` -> `/etc/neofs/config.yaml.migrated`).
WARN: carefully review the updated config before using it in the application!

FSTree storage provided with this version is more efficient for small files
than the Peapod in most cases. We support both `fstree` and `peapod` sub-storages,
but `peapod` can be removed in future versions. We recommend using `fstree`.
If you want to use only `fstree` and storage node already stores some data,
don't forget to perform data migration described above.

were removed from the node since 0.39.0, so if you're using any current NeoFS
node version it's not a problem. If you're using 0.38.0 or lower with
blobovniczas configured, please migrate using earlier releases.

## [0.41.1] - 2024-04-27

## [0.41.0] - 2024-04-19 - Daebudo

A very important release bringing a number of protocol changes. We have not
changed the protocol for more than a year, but now we're doing that to add
support for new functionality as well as fix long-standing issues.

### Added
- Support of numeric object search queries (#2733)
- Support of `GT`, `GE`, `LT` and `LE` numeric comparison operators in CLI (#2733)
- SN eACL processing of NULL and numeric operators (#2742)
- CLI now allows to create and print eACL with numeric filters (#2742)
- gRPC connection limits per endpoint (#1240)
- `neofs-lens object link` command for the new link object inspection (#2799)

- Storage nodes no longer accept objects with header larger than 16KB (#2749)
- IR sends NeoFS chain GAS to netmap nodes every epoch, not per a configurable blocks number (#2777)
- Big objects are split with the new split scheme (#2667, #2782, #2784, #2788, #2792, #2807)
- Background replicator transfers objects using new `ObjectService.Replicate` RPC (#2317)
- Tombstone objects are not allowed to store child objects (incomplete puts are exceptional) (#2810)

### Removed
- Object notifications incl. NATS (#2750)
- Supporting of `__NEOFS__NETMAP*` X-headers (#2751)

supported. All NATS servers running for this purpose only are no longer needed.
If your app depends on notifications transmitted to NATS, do not update and
create an issue please.

Stop attaching `__NEOFS__NETMAP*` X-headers to NeoFS API requests. If your app
is somehow tied to them, do not update and create an issue please.

Notice that this is the last release containing `blobovnicza-to-peapod`
migration utility. Blobovniczas were removed from the node since 0.39.0, so
if you're using any current NeoFS node version it's not a problem. If you're
using 0.38.0 or lower with blobovniczas configured, please migrate ASAP.

Remove `grpc.tls.use_insecure_crypto` from any storage node configuration.

Remove `timers.emit` from any inner ring configuration.

## [0.40.1] - 2024-02-22

### Fixed
- Inability to deploy contract with non-standard zone via neofs-adm (#2740)
- Container session token's `wildcard` field support (#2741)

### Updating from v0.40.0
We no longer provide .tag.gz binaries in releases, they always were just
duplicates, but if you're using them in some scripts please update to fetch
raw binaries. All binaries have OS in their names as well now, following
regular naming used throughout NSPCC, so instead of neofs-cli-amd64 you get
neofs-cli-linux-amd64 now.

CLI command `acl extended create` changed and extended input format for filters.
For example, `attr>=100` or `attr=` are now processed differently. See `-h` for details.

- Deadlock in autodeploy routine (#2720)
- SN now validates session tokens attached to objects (#1159)
- Object search server no longer wastes system resources sending empty intermediate messages to the stream (#2722)

### Changed

- IR can handle third-party notary requests without reliance on receiving the original one (#2715)
- SN validates container session token's issuer to be container's owner (#2466)
- Storage node now consumes much less memory when slicing small data of a fixed size (#2719)

### Removed
- Deprecated `neofs-adm [...] inspect` commands (#2603)

### Updated
- `neo-go` to `v0.105.1` (#2725)

### Updating from v0.39.2

### Updating from v0.38.1
Blobovniczas are gone from the node with this release, see 0.38.0 upgrade
notes for migration instruction (the tool is still provided, but will be gone
after a couple of minor releases).

neofs-adm no longer creates a contract group wallet and no longer needs it
for the operation which may affect deployment scripts.

Pre-0.39.0 storage nodes may not be able to register on the network running
0.39.0 inner ring nodes unless they provide complete LOCODE data in the
configuration (0.39.0 SNs add it automatically, so upgrade SNs).

`native_activations` subsection of `consensus` IR configuration should be
removed. It never actually did anything useful anyway.

Automatic contract deployments and updates require `fschain_autodeploy`
configuration, currently it's optional an IR behaves as previously by default.

## [0.38.1] - 2023-09-18

A tiny fix for peapod-enabled nodes.

### Fixed
- Inability to start node with peapods configured (#2576)
- `neofs-adm morph set-config` command error messages (#2556)

## [0.38.0] - 2023-09-13 - Gogado

A number of important fixes are brought by this release, including protocol
ones (subnet and system EACL changes), as well as an updated storage subsystem
and useful CLI updates making it more powerful and user-friendly at the same time.

Some previously deprecated configuration options were removed, so be careful
and this is the last minor release to support the Blobovnicza tree storage
subsystem. Starting with the next minor release, the component will be purged,
so be prepared (see `Updating` section) and migrate to more efficient and
simple Peapod.

- Fetching container estimations via iterators to prevent NeoVM stack overflow (#2173)
- `neofs-adm morph netmap-candidates` CLI command (#1889)
- SN network validation (is available by its announced addresses) on bootstrap by the IR (#2475)
- Display of container alias fee info in `neofs-cli netmap netinfo` (#2553)

- Missing connection retries on IR node startup when the first configured mainnet RPC node is not in sync (#2474)
- Storage node no longer ignores unhealthy shards on startup (#2464)
- Processing of status errors returned by API client from NeoFS SDK RC-9 (#2465)
- `neofs-lens write-cache list` command duplication (#2505)

### Removed
- Deprecated `morph.rpc_endpoint` SN and `morph.endpoint.client` IR config sections (#2400)
- `neofs_node_object_epoch` metric for IR and SN (#2347)
- Subnets support (#2411)
- Logging utility completely replaced with `zap.Logger` (#696)
- System eACL modification ability in the `neofs-cli` and `IR` (netmap candidate validation) (#2531)

### Changed
- CLI `--timeout` flag configures whole execution timeout from now (#2124)
- CLI default timeout for commands with `--await` flag increased to 1m (#2124)

- SN does not store container estimations in-mem forever (#2472)
- CLI `neofs-cli container set-eacl` checks container's ownership (#2436)

### Updated
- `neofs-sdk-go` to `v1.0.0-rc.11`

### Updating from v0.37.0
CLI command timeouts (flag `--timeout`) now limit the total command execution
time and not single network operation. If any commands suddenly start to fail
on timeout, try increasing the value, for example, twice. Also note that the
execution of commands with the `--await` flag and without an explicitly
specified time period is now limited to 1 minute. This value can be changed with
`--timeout` flag.
Histogram (not counter) RPC/engine operation handling time metrics were added. For
an old engine `*operation_name*_duration` a new `*operation_name*_time` is available.
For an old `*operation_name*_req_duration` RPC a new `rpc_*operation_name*_time` is
available. The old ones (the counters) have been deprecated and will be removed with
the following minor release.
Container estimation main node calculation has been changed. A new 32-byte long
array is taken as a sorting pivot: it is an estimated container with the first 8 bytes
replaced with a target epoch in a little-endian encoding now.

Deprecated `morph.rpc_endpoint` SN and `morph.endpoint.client` IR configurations
have been removed. Use `morph.endpoints` for both instead.
Deprecated `neofs_node_object_epoch` metric for IR and SN (the same for both)
has been removed. Use `neofs_node_state_epoch` for SN and `neofs_ir_state_epoch`
for IR instead.
Deprecated `--no-precheck` flag in `neofs-cli container set-eacl` use `--force` flag instead for skipping validation checks.

Subnets support has been removed:
- IR's `workers.subnet` and `contracts.subnet` configs are not used anymore.
- SN's `node.subnet` config section is not used anymore.
- `neoofs-amd morph` does not have `subnet` subcommand anymore.
- `neofs-cli container create` does not have `--subnet` flag anymore.

Docker images now contain a single executable file and SSL certificates only.

`neofs-cli control healthcheck` exit code is `0` only for "READY" state.

To migrate data from Blobovnicza trees to Peapods:
```shell
$ blobovnicza-to-peapod -config </path/to/storage/node/config>
```
For any shard, the data from the configured Blobovnicza tree is copied into
a created Peapod file named `peapod.db` in the directory where the tree is
located. For example, `/neofs/data/blobovcniza/*` -> `/neofs/data/peapod.db`.
Notice that existing Blobovnicza trees are untouched. Configuration is also
updated, for example, `/etc/neofs/config.yaml` -> `/etc/neofs/config_peapod.yaml`.
WARN: carefully review the updated config before using it in the application!

To store small objects in more effective and simple sub-storage Peapod, replace
`blobovnicza` sub-storage with the `peapod` one in `blobstor` config section.
If storage node already stores some data, don't forget to make data migration
described above.

`neofs_node_object_epoch` metric for IR and SN (the same for both) has been deprecated and will be removed with the
next minor release. Use `neofs_node_state_epoch` for SN and `neofs_ir_state_epoch` for IR instead.

Storage and Inner-ring nodes exposes their version via the `neofs_[node|ir]_version` metric now.

In the local consensus mode (IR) it is allowed to provide additional TLS setup addresses now, see
`morph.consensus.rpc.tls` section.
`morph.switch_interval` IR and SN config value is not used anymore.
`morph.rpc_endpoint` SN config value and `morph.endpoint.client` IR config value has been deprecated and will be
removed with the next minor release. Use `morph.endpoints` for both instead (NOTE: it does not have priorities now).

If you're using binary keys with neofs-cli (`-w`), convert them to proper
  NEP-6 wallets like this:
    $ xxd -p < path_to_binary.wallet # outputs hex-encoded key
    $ neofs-cli util keyer <hex_key> # outputs WIF
    $ neo-go wallet import -w <wallet_file> --wif <wif_key>
  or just generate/use new keys.

In local consensus mode `morph.validators` in IR's config can be omitted now, `morph.consensus.committee` will be used instead.
For detached consensus, it is a required config parameter now.

Replace using the `control netmap-snapshot` command with `netmap snapshot` one in NeoFS CLI.
Node can now specify additional addresses in `ExternalAddr` attribute. To allow a node to dial
other nodes external address, use `apiclient.allow_external` config setting.
Add `--force` option to skip placement validity check for container creation.

Pass `maintenance` state to `neofs-cli control set-status` to enter maintenance mode.
If network allows maintenance state (*), it will be reflected in the network map.
Storage nodes under maintenance are not excluded from the network map, but don't
serve object operations. (*) can be fetched from network configuration via
`neofs-cli netmap netinfo` command.

To allow maintenance mode during neofs-adm deployments, set
`network.maintenance_mode_allowed` parameter in config.

When issuing an object session token for root (virtual, "big") objects,
additionally include all members of the split-chain. If session context
includes root object only, it is not spread to physical ("small") objects.

`neofs-node` configuration now supports `mode: disabled` flag for a shard.
This can be used to temporarily ignore shards without completely removing them
from the config file.
