# Contribution guide

First, thank you for contributing! We love and encourage pull requests from
everyone. Please follow the guidelines:

- Check the open [issues](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-node/issues) and
  [pull requests](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-node/pulls) for existing
  discussions.

- Open an issue first, to discuss a new feature or enhancement.

- Write tests, and make sure the test suite passes locally and on CI.

- Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).

- Make sure your commits are logically separated and have good comments
  explaining the details of your change.

- After receiving feedback, amend your commits or add new ones as
  appropriate.

- **Have fun!**

## Development Workflow

Start by forking the `neofs-node` repository, make changes in a branch and then
send a pull request. We encourage pull requests to discuss code changes. Here
are the steps in details:

### Set up your GitHub Repository
Fork [NeoFS node upstream](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-node/fork) source
repository to your own personal repository. Copy the URL of your fork (you will
need it for the `git clone` command below).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-node
```

### Set up git remote as ``upstream``
```sh
$ cd neofs-node
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-node
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
...
```

### Create your feature branch
Before making code changes, make sure you create a separate branch for these
changes. Maybe you will find it convenient to name branch in
`<type>/<Issue>-<changes_topic>` format.

```
$ git checkout -b feature/123-something_awesome
```

### Test your changes
After your code changes, make sure

- To add test cases for the new code.
- To run `make lint`
- To squash your commits into a single commit or a series of logically separated
  commits run `git rebase -i`. It's okay to force update your pull request.
- To run `make test` and `make all` completes.

### Commit changes
After verification, commit your changes. This is a [great
post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write useful commit
messages. Try following this template:

```
[#Issue] <component> Summary

Description

<Macros>

<Sign-Off>
```

```
$ git commit -am '[#123] Add some feature'
```

### Push to the branch
Push your locally committed changes to the remote origin (your fork)
```
$ git push origin feature/123-something_awesome
```

### Create a Pull Request
Pull requests can be created via GitHub. Refer to [this
document](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for
detailed steps on how to create a pull request. After a Pull Request gets peer
reviewed and approved, it will be merged.

## DCO Sign off

All authors to the project retain copyright to their work. However, to ensure
that they are only submitting work that they have rights to, we are requiring
everyone to acknowledge this by signing their work.

Any copyright notices in this repository should specify the authors as "the

To sign your work, just add a line like this at the end of your commit message:

```

```

This can easily be done with the `--signoff` option to `git commit`.
